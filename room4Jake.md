Interest of content - Very good
There is detailed content especially under the covid-19 heading. 
However there could be more information about each subject.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Good
The webpage is very consistent throughout with formatting so this is good.
However the webpage is also quite blocky - with large chunks of text spanning the whole screen and images taking up whole rows It might be worth considering how to put images inline.

Quality of written presentation - Good
The information is there and under subheadings. But more efoort could be made to make it readable to humans as it is currently long walls of text that are hard to navigate.

Validity of HTML - Outstanding
The HTML works completely well throughout the whole page, the only tiny nitpicky thing is that the "Applications of computing" in the navbar looks like it has a link when you hover, but it doesn't.

Evidence of collaboration - Exemplary
Clear evidence of balanced contributions along with Author information made by different people.
